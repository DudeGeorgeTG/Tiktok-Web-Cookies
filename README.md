# TikTok Cookie Fetcher

This script extracts useful cookies from TikTok web endpoints, such as:

- `ttwid`: Used for identity verification and some session-based behavior.
- `msToken`: Often used in requests to TikTok's telemetry/reporting services.

These cookies can be useful for developers working on:

- TikTok data scraping (within ethical/legal bounds).
- API interaction that mimics browser behavior.
- Security testing or bot behavior simulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```bash
python tiktok_cookie_fetcher.py
```
Example output:
```
msToken: ZXY123abc...
ttwid: 78uyQWert...
```
